- Arigatou Gozaimashita - Said when bowing after an exercise, means "Thank You".
- [Gekisai Dai Ichi](/kata/gekisai-dai-ichi) - The name of the first [kata](/kata)
- Jodan - Upper level (Face Height)
- Chuudan - Middle level (The area below the head, but above the groin/bladder)
- Gedan - Lower level (The area below chuudan, includes the body and legs)
- Migi - Left
- Hidari - Right
