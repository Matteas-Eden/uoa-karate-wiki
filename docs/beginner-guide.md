## What is Karate

Karate is a martial art that focuses on unarmed techniques that use all parts of the anatomy. These techniques include: punching, striking, kicking, blocking, as well as grappling, locks and throws. The word “karate” is usually translated as “empty hand”, consistent with the notion of unarmed combat.

While there are many styles of karate, they all derive from martial arts developed on the island of Okinawa. These systems were strongly influenced by the martial arts of China, particularly Kung Fu.

### Goju-Ryu Karate

The Karate style of Goju-Ryu was founded by Sensei Chojun Miyagi and formally registered with the Japanese Martial Arts Association, in 1933. His instructor was Sensei Kanryo Higaonna, who taught a style known as “Naha-Te” (Naha was the town they lived in). Sensei Chojun Miyagi took what he had learned from his instructor, made changes based on his experience, and created a system (or curriculum) for learning. He named this style Goju-Ryu, which can be roughly translated as “Hard (go) soft (ju) school (ryu).” He chose this name because he felt it described the important characteristics of his style - namely, combining “hard” or striking techniques with “soft” or circular blocking techniques.

## International Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate Federation (IOGKF)

The IOGKF is an organisation that oversees the teaching of the Goju-Ryu style of Karate. It is dedicated to preserving the art of Goju-Ryu in the form handed down by its founder, Sensei Chojun Miyagi. It provides quality assurance and accreditation of instructors, as well as organising events around the world.

The Chief Instructor is Master Tetsuji Nakamura.

The IOGKF has affiliates in over 40 countries, more details are available from the IOGKF website: www.iogkf.com

## Training

A training session will usually follow a standard pattern. Generally, students line up in order of rank facing shomen with the most senior student at the right end of the front row and most junior student at the left end of the back row. The instructor (Sensei) is at the centre front facing the students.

There may be variations at different Dojos depending on the preferences of the instructor (e.g., if there is more than one instructor).

Different Dojos will have differing levels of formality in Dojo. A moderately formal Dojo will have opening and closing ceremonies for each training session. These ceremonies may involve sitting in “seiza” (sitting with legs folded underneath) and “mokuso” (meditation). Everyone bows (“rei”) on entry to and on leaving the Dojo, and to instructor or training partners when beginning and ending exercises. The phrase onegai shimasu (please teach me) is used before beginning any exercises (either to the instructor or to the training partners) and domo arigato gozaimashita (thank you very much for teaching me) at the end.

For a full breakdown of what goes on in a training session, [see this page](/training.md).

## Terminology

It'll all sound like gibberish at first so don't worry if you don't get it right away, for now here are a list of the most basic words you should learn to start:

- Onegaishimasu - Said when bowing before an exercise, means "Please (teach me)"
- Arigatou Gozaimashita - Said when bowing after an exercise, means "Thank You".
- [Gekisai Dai Ichi](/kata/gekisai-dai-ichi.md) - The name of the first [kata](/kata/)
- Jodan - Upper level (Face Height.md)
- Chuudan - Middle level (The area below the head, but above the groin/bladder)
- Gedan - Lower level (The area below chuudan, includes the body and legs)
- Migi - Left
- Hidari - Right

## Dojo Etiquette

Foremost in Karate is respect. It is also important to respect your dojo, your partners, your teachers, your training equipment, and yourself.

This includes bowing on entry and exit (of the dojo), not wearing shoes on the dojo floor, wearing clean clothing and being personally clean, having short nails (to avoid injuring a partner), and being on time for training.

Students should avoid reasons for leaving the Dojo during training by going to the toilet beforehand, and having all equipment readily available. If you must leave the dojo or stop training due to any reason (especially if you are not feeling well), please speak to the instructor or a senior member before you leave so your absence is known. Part of this is for health and safety reasons.
