## What is Karate

Karate is a martial art that focuses on unarmed techniques that use all parts of the anatomy. These techniques include: punching, striking, kicking, blocking, as well as grappling, locks, and throws. The word “karate” is usually translated as “empty hand”, consistent with the notion of unarmed combat.

While there are many styles of karate, they all derive from martial arts developed on the island of Okinawa. These systems were strongly influenced by the martial arts of China, particularly Kung Fu.

### Goju-Ryu Karate

The Karate style of Goju-Ryu was founded by Sensei Chojun Miyagi and formally registered with the Japanese Martial Arts Association, in 1933. His instructor was Sensei Kanryo Higaonna, who taught a style known as “Naha-Te” (Naha was the town they lived in). Sensei Chojun Miyagi took what he had learned from his instructor, made changes based on his experience, and created a system (or curriculum) for learning. He named this style Goju-Ryu, which can be roughly translated as “Hard (go) soft (ju) school (ryu).” He chose this name because he felt it described the important characteristics of his style - namely, combining “hard” or striking techniques with “soft” or circular blocking techniques.

For more info on Goju Ryu's history and significant people related to it, see [this page](goju-ryu.md).

## International Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate Federation (IOGKF)

The IOGKF is an organisation that oversees the teaching of the Goju-Ryu style of Karate. It is dedicated to preserving the art of Goju-Ryu in the form handed down by its founder, Sensei Chojun Miyagi. It provides quality assurance and accreditation of instructors, as well as organising events around the world. The founder and former World Chief Instructor is Master Morio Higaonna. The current World Chief Instructor is Master Tetsuji Nakamura.

The IOGKF has affiliates in over 40 countries, more details are available from the IOGKF website: [www.iogkf.com](https://www.iogkf.com)

## IOGKF New Zealand (IOGKFNZ)

IOGKF New Zealand is affiliated to the IOGKF. It has about 30 Dojos (training centres) and operates within a framework of democracy and accountability. A technical committee (the Kambukai) ensures that the quality of instruction at individual Dojos remains consistently high and up-to-date. It also organises national training events, and visits to New Zealand by overseas instructors. All Kambukai members have trained extensively with Master Higaonna, both overseas and during his frequent trips to New Zealand. The current Kambukai members have over 90 years karate experience between them.

## Training

A training session will usually follow a standard pattern. Generally, students line up in order of rank facing shomen with the most senior student at the right end of the front row and most junior student at the left end of the back row. The instructor (Sensei) is at the center front facing the students.

There may be variations at different Dojos depending on the preferences of the instructor (e.g., if there is more than one instructor).

Different Dojos will have differing levels of formality in Dojo. A moderately formal Dojo will have opening and closing ceremonies for each training session. These ceremonies may involve sitting in “seiza” (sitting with legs folded underneath) and “mokuso” (meditation). Everyone bows (“rei”) on entry to and on leaving the Dojo, and to instructor or training partners when beginning and ending exercises. The phrase onegai shimasu (please teach me) is used before beginning any exercises (either to the instructor or to the training partners) and domo arigato gozaimashita (thank you very much for teaching me) at the end.

For a full breakdown of what goes on in a training session, [see this page](/training.md).

## Ranks

Karate has a sequence of “coloured belt” ranks, beginning at white (beginner) and ending at black. Coloured belt ranks are divided into 10 “kyu” grades, with 10th kyu being the most junior and 1st kyu being the rank immediately before black belt. For Goju Ryu the kyu grade belt colours are as follows:

| Grade    | Belt Colour               |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Ungraded | White                     |
| 10th Kyu | White with a black tab    |
| 9th Kyu  | Blue                      |
| 8th Kyu  | Blue with a black tab     |
| 7th Kyu  | Yellow                    |
| 6th Kyu  | Yellow with a black tab   |
| 5th Kyu  | Green                     |
| 4th Kyu  | Green with a black tab    |
| 3rd Kyu  | Brown                     |
| 2nd Kyu  | Brown with a black tab    |
| 1st Kyu  | Brown with two black tabs |

The rank of black belt is like any other rank-based or qualification system. It denotes that the holder has reached a certain level of standard as defined by the organisation that grants the rank.

There is also a graduation for black belts. The lowest black belt rank is “shodan” (first degree black belt), followed by “nidan” (second degree), “sandan”, and so on to “judan” (10th degree). Judan is the highest possible rank, which is conferred only to those who have spent a lifetime in the study and practice of karate, and so is very rare.

Unlike kyu grades there is usually no way to tell grade from looking at the belt, as the belts are only black. Many students will have their belts embroidered with their style name, and their own name.

Natural physical ability, level of training, and experience in other styles all affect how long it takes to reach shodan, but it is usually not less than four years.

## Grading

A grading is the examination for karate. Students participating in a grading must demonstrate that they have reached the required level for the next rank in order to be promoted to that rank. Information on gradings can be found [here](grading.md)

## Competition

A Karate tournament is usually made up of Kata and Kumite (sparring) competitions. Each of these can be further divided by gender, age group and rank. Kumite can also consist of Shiai (controlled-contact points sparring) and/or Iri-Kumi (full-contact fighting).

Our club regularly participates in a Kata and Shiai sparring tournament held in Pukekohe twice a year.

## Terminology

It'll all sound like gibberish at first so don't worry if you don't get it right away, for now here are a list of the most basic words you should learn to start:

- Onegaishimasu - Said when bowing before an exercise, means "Please (teach me)"
- Arigatou Gozaimashita - Said when bowing after an exercise, means "Thank You".
- [Gekisai Dai Ichi](/kata/gekisai-dai-ichi.md) - The name of the first [kata](/kata/)
- Jodan - Upper level (face height)
- Chuudan - Middle level (The area below the head, but above the groin/bladder)
- Gedan - Lower level (The area below chuudan, includes the body and legs)
- Migi - Left
- Hidari - Right

See [Vocabulary](/vocabulary.md) for a more comprehensive list of Karate Vocabulary.
See [Japanese](/japanese.md) for information on learning/pronouncing Japanese.

## The Gi (Uniform)

The uniform worn for karate is called a “Gi.” It is white and made of heavy cotton with strong stitching to withstand the rigour of hard training. Part of the Gi is a long cotton belt (obi). You do not have to have a Gi in order to train, and often beginners will wait until they have trained for a few months before buying one.

For instruction on how to tie your belt, ask a graded member or click [here](/etiquette.md#how-to-tie-your-belt).

## Dojo Etiquette

Foremost in Karate is respect. It is also important to respect your dojo, your partners, your teachers, your training equipment, and yourself.

This includes bowing on entry and exit (of the dojo), not wearing shoes on the dojo floor, wearing clean clothing and being personally clean, having short nails (to avoid injuring a partner), and being on time for training.

Students should avoid reasons for leaving the Dojo during training by going to the toilet beforehand, and having all equipment readily available. If you must leave the dojo or stop training due to any reason (especially if you are not feeling well), please speak to the instructor or a senior member before you leave so your absence is known. Part of this is for health and safety reasons.

See [Etiquette](/etiquette.md) for information on dojo etiquette.

## Opening and closing ceremonies

See [Ceremonies](/ceremonies.md) for information on the opening and closing ceremonies.
