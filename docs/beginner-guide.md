## The Japanese we use at training

It'll all sound like gibberish at first so don't worry if you don't get it right away, for now here are a list of the most basic words you should learn to start:

- Onegaishimasu - Said when bowing before an exercise, means "Please (teach me)"
- Arigatou Gozaimashita - Said when bowing after an exercise, means "Thank You".
- Gekisai Dai Ichi - The name of the first [[kata]]
- Jodan - Upper level (Face Height)
- Chuudan - Middle level (The area below the head, but above the groin/bladder)
- Gedan - Lower level (The area below chuudan, includes the body and legs)
- Migi - Left
- Hidari - Right
