> Practise Daily and Protect Traditional Karate

This is intended to be a reference resource for the study of Goju Ryu Karate and Karate in general. It's not an authoritative source (though it does strive to be as accurate as possible) and as such everything should be taken with a grain of salt. When in doubt, consult an instructor or senior member.
