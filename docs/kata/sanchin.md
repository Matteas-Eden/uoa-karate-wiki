# Sanchin

## Name Meaning

The name "Sanchin" is composed of the characters "Three" (<ruby><rb>三</rb><rt>さん</rt></ruby>) and "Battle"(<ruby><rb>戦</rb><rt>ちん</rt></ruby>), thus meaning "Three Battles".　 These battles are commonly thought to be the battles of the mind, body and spirit; which can all be improved by the practice of Sanchin, or so the story goes.

## Kata History

[Chojun Miyagi] learned this kata from [Kanryo Higaonna] and made several changes to it, including:

- Using closed fists instead of open hands
- The method of breathing
- The foot work involved

Two versions of 'Sanchin' exist in [Goju Ryu], "Higaonna", and "Miyagi". "Higaonna" retains the turns of Higaonna's original version. "Higaonna Sanchin" is also known as "Sanchin Dai Ni"
