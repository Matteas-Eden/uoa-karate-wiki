## What is a Kata?

A Kata (also know as: a form or a pattern) is a set of movements and techniques performed in a prescribed sequence and manner of execution. Kata serve as a 'library' of useful techniques, stances, and movements. These sequences can be taken apart and analysed (a method known in Japanese as 'Bunkai' <ruby><rb>分</rb><rt>ぶん</rt><rb>解</rb><rt>かい</rt></ruby>) to discover self-defense applications (known as 'Oyo' in Japanese <ruby><rb>応</rb><rt>おう</rt><rb>用</rb><rt>よう</rt></ruby>). These applications could contain anything from simple evade-and-counter combos, joint locking techniques, throws and takedowns, escapes from wrist and clothing grabs and more.

In Japanese, 'Kata' generally refers to a method of doing something or a sequence of movements. It can be written in a few different ways but the most common when referring to a 'Karate Kata' are 「方」, 「形」 or 「型」.

## Tips

### Common mistakes in kata to watch out for

- Short-cutting techniques. i.e. not fully completing a technique before starting the next
- Stances too short/too long
- Incorrect angles. Angles become quite common in kata starting from Seiyunchin, and an incorrect angle in one portion of the kata can mess up all the rest
- Rushing the kata. It's quite important that you take the time to complete each technique before starting the next. Forcing yourself to pause and completely stop your movement for a second or two can be a good way to ensure you aren't rushing anything.

### Memorizing a kata

- Practise it a lot
- Train it in different places
- Start facing in different directions than usual when practising
- Start from different points in the kata, e.g. 5 moves in, after a particular sequence of techniques finishes, be creative
- Perform it slowly, pause after each technique
- Perform it quickly, no pausing
