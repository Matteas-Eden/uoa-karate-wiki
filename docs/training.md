# Training

A training session will usually follow a standard pattern. Generally, students line up in order of rank facing shomen with the most senior student at the right end of the front row and most junior student at the left end of the back row. The instructor (Sensei) is at the centre front facing the students.

There may be variations at different Dojos depending on the preferences of the instructor (e.g., if there is more than one instructor).

Different Dojos will have differing levels of formality in Dojo. A moderately formal Dojo will have opening and closing ceremonies for each training session. These ceremonies may involve sitting in “seiza” (sitting with legs folded underneath) and “mokuso” (meditation). Everyone bows (“rei”) on entry to and on leaving the Dojo, and to instructor or training partners when beginning and ending exercises. See the [ceremonies](ceremonies.md) page for more information.

The phrase onegai shimasu (please teach me) is used before beginning any exercises (either to the instructor or to the training partners) and domo arigato gozaimashita (thank you very much for teaching me) at the end.

## Training format

A typical training session will feature some or all of the following activities.

### Warm-up/Fitness (Junbi Undo)

As with any form of exercise, it is always good to begin with warm-ups. Karate sessions will often have a set of exercises designed to raise the heart-rate followed by stretching exercises. Training sessions generally help with fitness, and there are specific fitness exercises to improve stamina and strength (e.g., sit-ups, press-ups, squats).

### Basics (Kihon)

The simplest forms of activities specific to Karate are: Moving (sabaki), Punching (tsuki), Kicking (keri), Blocking (uke).
These are the “basics” which form the fundamentals of Karate so a significant amount of time is spent on these, especially by beginners (although all Karate-ka learn to understand the importance of basics and continually try to improve their technique).

### Moving basics

Moving quickly with poise and balance is something that must be learned. There are a number of different kinds of movement, from various forms of stepping staying in the same stance or changing stances, to sliding (suri ashi) or turning (tai sabaki).

### Combinations

Single techniques are rarely useful, so it is necessary to develop the physical ability to combine techniques in an effective way. This training can consist of combinations done stationary, and while moving.

### Kata

Kata are sequences of pre-arranged movements and techniques. The true meaning and spirit of Goju-Ryu Karate exist within the Kata. The Kata include movements and combinations of techniques applied with full speed and power in an organised framework. Proper execution of Kata only comes with proper execution of the basics, quick and smooth movement, and clearly focused combinations of techniques. There are a total of 12 Goju Ryu kata. For more information [visit the page on kata](/kata/).

### Bunkai (Self-defence applications)

Bunkai are the application of the movements of the Kata against an opponent. The Kata do not exist just as a form of exercise for demonstration purposes. They embody a large number of self-defence applications.

Without understanding how the self-defence applications are developed from the Kata, the Kata is just a form of dance. Students are taught basic bunkai but many variations exist, and students can even develop their own once they have acquired an understanding of the movements of the kata.

### Partner work

Working with a partner improves accuracy of techniques (whether attack or defence), distancing and timing, conditioning, and gets one used to being attacked and being hit. Partners are necessary for practising bunkai, but often will be used for basics as well (e.g., one side doing basic punching while the other blocks).

### Sparring (Kumite)

Kumite is a controlled form of fighting. There are different forms, corresponding to the degree of control over the movements. A simple form is ippon kumite, or one-step sparring which consists of a single attack and corresponding defence. Other forms include san dan gi, involving 3 steps, 3 attacks at 3 different levels, and the corresponding defences. Randori is continuous attack and defence, emphasising technique and combinations, but with minimal contact. Jiyu kumite is at full speed with some hard contact particularly to the body. Go kumite is full contact. In all cases, emphasis is on safety and control. Safety equipment is often used, particularly for Go kumite. Even with the lighter forms, a mouth guard should be considered the absolute minimum.

### Supplementary Exercises (Hojo-undo)

There are a number of traditional pieces of equipment used in Goju-Ryu, developed in the early days before the modern gym existed. These include the makiwara (striking post) and chiishi (stone lever weight, see right).

The order given on this page might be considered a “standard” order, in that it provides an organised progression starting from relatively straightforward to exercises requiring more and more skill. However, most sessions will not include all categories (e.g., due to time constraints).
Different instructors have their preferences, and the order might be changed to provide variety or to emphasise different things. Sometimes activities from one category might be used for other goals. For example, exercises for learning how to move might be used for warm-ups; a class consisting of senior students may use kata or sparring for warm-ups. Other forms of training are also used. Training in water (whether at the beach or in a swimming pool) are also popular. Instructors will also often bring in techniques and exercises from other martial arts or forms of exercise.

## Training Area (Dojo)

Karate training takes place in a Dojo. This can be anywhere from a patch of grass in a park, to a permanent facility dedicated to training. A permanent facility will often have a shinden (shrine) at the front (shomen), otherwise shomen will be a designated direction.
