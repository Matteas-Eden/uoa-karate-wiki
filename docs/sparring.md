## General Tips

- Don't beat up your opponent, we're all here to practise, not to brawl.
- Use angles as a way to avoid your opponents attacks and as a way to attack your opponent where they're vulnerable.
- Use combinations, one punch is easy to deal with, but 4 punches and a kick is a lot more difficult to handle.
- Keep your guard/hands up, getting punched in the face sucks.
- Don't look where you're going to attack as it will give away your intentions
- Be relaxed as much as possible. Being tense will tire you out and slow you down.
- Keep control of your breathing, if you run out of breath it's game over.
- Don't let your opponent control the tempo of the fight, you can let them think they are though.
- Keep light on your feet to move quickly
- Use your hips to move faster and to generate more power
