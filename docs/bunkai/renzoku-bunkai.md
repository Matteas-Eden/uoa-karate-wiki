Renzoku Bunkai 「連続分解」 or "Continuous Application" (also known as two-person kata) are two person drills based off of [[kata]].
Generally one person is designated the "Defender" and one the "Attacker", both persons will perform a predetermined sequence of attacks, defenses and movements based off of a kata. These can be used to practice speed, timing and techniques in a controlled environment and with variable pressure (you can raise or lower the intensity as needed).

# Sandangi

While not exactly based off of a kata, Sandangi is more or less a Renzoku Bunkai in terms of what it trains.

## Important Points

*Stances are sanchin dachi -> hanzen kutsu dachi -> shikodachi -> repeat
*Attacks are Jodan, chudan, gedan.
*Ensure your stances are not too long and make sure your shikodachi is on a 45˚ angle.
*Keep contact with your partner as much as possible, you should feel them move before you see them move. This is [[muchimi]], press on them and 'stick' to your partner.
