# Yakusoku Kumite

Yakusoku Kumite translates as pre-arranged sparring.

The following are 10 sets of prearranged attacks and defences. The defences apply kata techniques, you could consider these to be another set of formal bunkai for our kata. Some of them are quite similar to our usual formal bunkai and others are more advanced, featuring various throws and takedowns, as well as locks and ground techniques.
